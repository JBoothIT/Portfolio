This needs to be done for it to work:
OpenVPN GUI must be installed and not running. 
OpenVPN GUI added to environment variables for CMD
.ovpn auto login profile needs to be in C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config


Python code works by running a CMD command that points to the OpenVPN GUI set in environment variables and connects with the given profile.


Needs to be done:
OS check
Checks for OpenVpn running and closes if it is
Checks for OpenVPn in path?
Added functionalities: multihops
Gui?
