;; Assignment 1: Implementing PageRank
;;
;; PageRank is a popular graph algorithm used for information
;; retrieval and was first popularized as an algorithm powering
;; the Google search engine. Details of the PageRank algorithm will be
;; discussed in class. Here, you will implement several functions that
;; implement the PageRank algorithm in Racket.
;;
;; Hints: 
;; 
;; - For this assignment, you may assume that no graph will include
;; any "self-links" (pages that link to themselves) and that each page
;; will link to at least one other page.
;;
;; - you can use the code in `testing-facilities.rkt` to help generate
;; test input graphs for the project. The test suite was generated
;; using those functions.
;;
;; - You may want to define "helper functions" to break up complicated
;; function definitions.
